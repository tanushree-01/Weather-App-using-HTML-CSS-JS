# Weather-App-using-HTML-CSS-JS
The weather app I created is built using html, CSS, and JavaScript. I also updated my app with the most recent weather data from anywhere in the world using an open API named "openweathermap". It is a webpage that can be found on Google. You will receive an "apikey" upon registering an account, and the required weather "apiurl" may be found in the API.

The images I used are from flaticon, and here is the link:
