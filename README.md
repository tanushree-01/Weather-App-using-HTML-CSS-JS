# Weather-App-using-HTML-CSS-JS
I created a weather app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I further updated my app with the most recent weather data from anywhere in the world using an open API named "openweathermap". It is a webpage that can be found on Google. You will receive an apikey upon registering an account, and the required weather API URL may be found in the API.
To create your own app, you can refer to this link for guidance:
